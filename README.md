### ii) Aire (quandrant plots, mitigation plan) Mary

One of the floods we looked at was the Boxing Day flood of the River Aire in Leeds in 2015. Taking a threshold height of 3.9m above which flooding occured, we were able to produce the following quadrant plot using Python or R. This threshold height was estimated by Professor Bokhove by looking at photographs of the local area, along with their timestamps.

The lower left quadrant the relationship between the river height and time, the upper right quadrant shows time against flow, and the upper left quadrant contains a rating curve with a linear approximation. The dashed lines indicate a threshold height $h_T$ and the mean height of the flood $h_M$, and their respective flow rates $Q_M$ and $Q_T$. Using these values we were able to calculate the FEV as $9.34$M$m^3$, with $T_f$ (the duration of the flood) being 32 hours.
